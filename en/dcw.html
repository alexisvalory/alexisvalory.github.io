                <h2>Since 2017</h2>
                <p><a href="https://designerchairwarehouse.com/" alt="link">Designer Chair Warehouse</a> curates some of the finest seating options for your home or office. For individuals who take form and function seriously. It all started as a passion project in 2017 when they found that it was frustratingly difficult to find a statement piece of furniture, of acceptable quality, at an affordable price. The company was incorporated in 2018 and the business has grown from there. From their showroom in Cape Townâ€™s city, DCW serve customers throughout South Africa.</p> 

                <h2>2023 Edition</h2>
                <p>After working with Willem for <a href="le_roux_attorneys_inc.html" alt="link">Le Roux Attorneys Inc</a>, I got the chance to work on his side-business, Designer Chair Warehouse, by laying-out the new catalogue for 2023 in Indesign, in order to produce the catalogue of 2023, listing around 40 chairs. I didn't really know much about this subject before but thanks to this mission I realised how many chairs around us, at home, at the office, everywhere, are inspired by a mix of 20 international designers since the beginning of the 21st century...</p>
