                <h2>Reveal your screenwriting skills!</h2>
                <p>Creative Script was a script competition that I organized with friends during the summer of 2019. The goal was to promote script creativity by writing from 3 corpus elements: An image, a word and a sound. The idea comes from when I was younger, I had a huge book with a photo on each page and each page represented a year ("Century" by Bruce Bernard). And I always ask myself the question of what could happen in these scenes, what stories and dialogues could we create. </p>

                <h2>For and by creative people</h2>
                <p>I had a first competition session where the winner chose the final logo from my 3 graphic proposals. For the other 2 competitions, the winner of the competition saw his scenario be semi-illustrated: a written page facing an illustrated page, mirrored. The illustrators, whom I personally paid, were also part of my entourage. Two stories were therefore able to be printed: "The girl" written Benjamin Lemaitre and illustrated by Antoine Plouviez, then "In the pines" written Paul HyaumÃ© and illustrated by Etienne Rabin.</p>
